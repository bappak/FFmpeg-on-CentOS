Installing FFmpeg can be a real pain in the ass, but here's a script that you can simply execute and it will do it's magic. 
 
Just copy the contents of the code below to a file named install_ffmpeg.sh and execute the following:

<b>chmod +x install_ffmpeg.sh <br/>
./install_ffmpeg.sh</b>


You will be prompted with "Ready?" after every software package that is installed to check if installation was successful.
